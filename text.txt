Graffiti Game:
	This was the first project that I created as a web developer. Although it has many shortcomings, I am very proud of its design and execution. I planned an in-browser game using html, css, and javascript that allows the player to control a character who must spray-paint a builidng before being caught by the police.

Amsterdam-Colors:
	I built the front end and the back end. Design tool. Museum.

Rickify:
	Group project based on a class joke--photo manipulation; most important was working within a team and using git to coherently collaborate.

About Me:
	Worked as a public defender, loved the work but after 10 years was ready for a change, enjoy making things and beginning a new a career.
